### Hello, my name is Mace Fields, but I go by Violet Fields, and I've been a Minecraft server enthusiest for the past 9 and a half years (I started when I was 12).

# I'm currently 21, seeking job experience involving the following programming/markup languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript/JQuery, PHP, Java, as I know a little bit of each, but I would like to know how to do more.

- I'm currently working on setting up a Minecraft server, updating every plugin I come across, and hosting my own website: https://www.auccuatt.com/
- As of May, 2021, I am finishing my Computer and Information Systems certificates at Chemeketa Community College: Computer Programming, and Web Developer
- In the past, I have worked as a Customer Service Associate at Walgreens through a job experience foundation by the name of Garten Services: https://garten.org/

# Web projects I have worked on so far are:

- Minesweeper, I built this as a final project back in high school while trying to learn JQuery in an independent projects class: http://techismylife.com/MineSweeper/07_Minesweeper/
- My own website, this is currently hosted on my own web server I set up using Internet Information Services (IIS) using a custom SSL certificate by LetsEncrypt: https://www.auccuatt.com/

# I'm looking to collaborate with:

- Web Designers to reach an end goal of a complete website with JavaScript/JQuery functionalities, appropriate layout with cross-compatibility with most popular web browsers using CSS and CSS media queries, writing Hyper-Text Markup to update outdated code,

# Strengths

- When I start on web design project, I don't stop working, I usually finish the task without wanting to take breaks.
- I'm passionate about logic and algorithms, I can visualize how an API works and translate that into working code.
- I don't stop something I started.
- Independent worker, if you give me a web design task, I will complete the task without needing to ask for help.
- Project professionalism, I like making websites look better than anyone elses, if I'm given a web design project, I try my best to make it look and work the best that it can possibly be.

# Weaknesses

- I have 5 disabilities, including high-functioning Autism Spectrum Disorder, and Bipolar Disorder, however there's not very many downsides to this as my disability helps me see mulitple ways of solving a problem, I don't just see one solution, the result is what matters.
- For me, understanding a project's paradigm is somewhat difficult, as I look at every detail and look ahead to how it's going to work right before I write down pseudocode; however, as soon as I commit to writing psudocode to understand the problem, I fix the solution in a realitively timely matter.

# Preferred Pronouns:

She/Her

# Fun Facts:

- In addition to learning how to code, I am also learning how to create music using FL Studio as I've taught myself the Piano when I was 7 years old.
- I graduated high school with above a 3.0 GPA.
- My real name was named after the Star Wars character named "Mace" from the Ewok Adventure, in addition, I have never watched any of the Star Wars movies.
